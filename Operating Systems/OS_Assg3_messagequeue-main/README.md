QUESTIONS

1.
Consider the scenario where there are five students (ID: 1-5), a Teaching Assistant (TA)
[ID: 10], and a Course Instructor (CI) [ID: 100] in a class. The CI sends the marks scored
(out of 50) by the five students via a message queue so that only the particular student
can read his/her marks from the message queue. However, the TA can read the marks of
all the individual students also. The TA calculates the class average and assigns a grade
for each student and send it back to the CI. The students cannot read the class average
and their grades * .
Design and Implement the above scenario using Message Queue.
